# Meadowlark Project Board

This repository is responsible for hosting the kanban-style project management system for [Meadowlark] and parts of [RustyDAW], an open-source Digital Audio Workstation project.

- The [Meadowlark UI Project Board] for tracking development of the UI.
- The [RustyDAW Plugins Project Board] for tracking development of the DSP and various plugins for use with the RustyDAW project (and by extension Meadowlark).

# Get Involved

Before contributing or participating in discussions with the community, you should familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct].

- Come join us on the [Meadowlark Discord Server]! (music artists, designers, developers, and general users welcome!)

- We are also active in the [Rust Audio Discord Server] where we develop some of the generic backend modules for the [RustyDAW] project. Please keep discussions there about the [RustyDAW] project and not about [Meadowlark] specifically. (developers only please)

- Developers may take a look at the current [MVP Design Document]. Note we are currently not accepting code contributions to the core project until things are more fleshed out and less "experimental". However, we will be accepting contributions to any DSP since that can easily be delegated and developed in parallel. Take a look at the [DSP Design Document] if you are interested.

*(I'm not a fan of how GitHub Projects assigns every task as an "issue" in that repository and clutters up the issues tab. So I'm using this repository as a dedicated place to hold all of the generated issues instead.)*
