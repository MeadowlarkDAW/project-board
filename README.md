# Meadowlark Project Board

This repository is responsible for hosting the kanban-style project management system for [Meadowlark](https://github.com/MeadowlarkDAW/Meadowlark), an open-source DAW.

Note that I am no longer accepting code contributions to this project for the foreseeable future. I'll explain why in a future blogpost.

*(I'm not a fan of how GitHub Projects assigns every task as an "issue" in that repository and clutters up the issues tab. So I'm using this repository as a dedicated place to hold all of the generated issues instead.)*
